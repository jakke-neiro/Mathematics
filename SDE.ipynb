    "A scalar standard Brownian motion or standard Wiener process over $[0, T]$ is a random variable $W(t)$ that depends continuously on $t \\in [0, T]$ and satisfies the following three conditions. \n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item $W(0) = 0$ (with probability 1)\n",
    "    \\item For $0 \\leq s < t \\leq T$ the random variable given by the increment $W(t) - W(s)$ is normally distributed with mean zero and variance $t-s$; equivalently, $W(t) - W(s) \\sim \\sqrt{t-s}N(0,1)$ where $N(0,1)$ denotes a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "    \\item For $0 \\leq s < t < u < v \\leq T$ the increments $W(t) - W(s)$ and $W(v) - W(u)$ are independent.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "For computational purposes it is useful to consider discretized Brownian motion, where $W(t)$ is specified at discrete $t$ values. We thus set $\\delta t = T/N$ for some positive integer $N$ and let $W_j$ denote $W(t_j)$ with $t_j = j \\delta t$. Therefore\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "W_j = W_{j-1} + dW_j, j=1,2, \\dots, N\n",

    "\\subsubsection{Itô integral definition}\n",
    "Given a suitable function $h$, the integral $\\int_0^T h(t)dt$ may be approximated by the Riemann sum\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\sum_{j=0}^{N_1}h(t_j)(t_{j+1} - t_j)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where the discrete points $t_j = j \\delta t$ were introduced in subsection 2. Indeed, the integral may be defined by taking the limit $\\delta t \\to 0$. In a similar way, we may consider a sum of the form\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}h(t_j)(W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "which by analogy with the Riemann sum may be regarded as an approximation to a stochastic integral $\\int_0^T h(t)dW(t)$. Here, we are integrating $h$ with respect to Brownian motion. \n",

    "\\]\n",
    "If $h(t) = W(t)$, the sum requires $W(t)$ to be evaluated at $t = (t_j + t_{j+1})/2$. It can be shown that forming $(W(t_j) + W(t_{j+1}))/2$ and adding an independent $N(0, \\Delta t/4)$ increment gives a value for $W((t_j + t_{j+1})/2$ that maintains the three conditions of Brownian motion. \n",

    "Interstingly, the Itô and Stratonovich integrals give markedly different answers even when $\\delta t \\to 0$. Highlights a significant difference between deterministic and stochastic integration!\n",

    "Now the term $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}(W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j))^2$ can be shown to have expected value $T$ and variance $O(\\delta t)$. Hence, for small $\\delta t$ we expect this random variable to be close to the constant $T$. This leads to \n",
